# QuantiBike

QuantiBike is a IOS App to track the headmovements of cyclists to quantify their perceived safety. The project is part of a running science project by Andrii Matviienko and Manuel Leh√© in cooperation with the TK Lab on the TU Darmstadt, Germany.

## Prequisits

### Software

The project was build and tested on an iOS 16.2 device, but should be easily ported on lower versions.  

### Hardware

The app utilizes the accelerometer of modern AirPods and iPhones. The project mainly used AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro (2. Gen) in combination with an iPhone 12 Pro.

## Current Status

The App was used to conduct small studies as part of my thesis. The setup worked for our purposes but their are defintily improvements possible. The planned and possible improvements are documented as issues.
